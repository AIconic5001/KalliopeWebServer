This mixed-methods study combines both qualitative and quantitative approaches to capture the complexity of the research issue.

Detailed research design includes:

- Survey questionnaire administered to a sample of 500 small-scale farmers across six countries in SSA (Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda);
- Focus group discussions with 20 farmer representatives from each country to gather contextualized data on local knowledge systems and traditional farming practices;
- Secondary analysis of national-level datasets on climate indicators (e.g., temperature, precipitation) and agricultural production metrics (e.g., yield, price).

Data collection methods involved:

- Face-to-face interviews with farmers using semi-structured questionnaires;
- Observational notes during focus group sessions;
- Review of secondary sources including government reports, scientific articles, and extension service publications.

Analysis techniques included:

- Descriptive statistics and inferential tests (ANOVA, regression) to explore associations between climate variables and agricultural outcomes;
- Thematic coding and content analysis to identify emergent themes from qualitative data;
- Systematic review of relevant literature to inform theoretical frameworks and conceptual models.

Theoretical frameworks employed draw upon theories of climate justice, adaptive capacity, and social capital, emphasizing the interplay between environmental degradation, economic marginalization, and human rights violations.
