## Visualization Feat (Du Nguyen):

Where to add the visualization d3:

1. go to src/pages/Synopsis/CitationTimeline/CitationTimeline.tsx
2. Add any d3 visualization there
3. There are 2 ways of doing this: Either Try d3 library with React or create a js file in this file and try to call the function into the div. Any mock data can be created locally in this folder or in `assets` folder
