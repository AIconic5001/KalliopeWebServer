Research Problem and Objectives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The research problem addressed in this study revolves around the limitations of traditional methods for collecting and analyzing emotional responses to video stimuli. Specifically, the dual demands of video observation and annotation tasks impose a cognitive burden on annotators, compromising the quality of the data collected. Furthermore, the requirement for conscious rating in such tasks may affect long-term efficiency. These limitations pose significant scientific and practical challenges in the field of affective computing.

The study aims to address these challenges by exploring the application of inter-subject correlation (ISC) analysis, a method that has been successfully utilized in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research to establish the reliability of shared responses across different cinematic experiences. The research objectives are multifaceted:

1.  To investigate the feasibility of using ISC analysis with electroencephalography (EEG) data to capture variations in human emotional arousal in response to video stimuli.
2.  To evaluate the performance of ISC analysis in detecting significant variations in shared responses among the audience, using EEG data collected during the viewing of film clips with different emotional labels (happy, neutral, sad).
3.  To compare the results of ISC analysis with traditional methods of emotional response collection and analysis, highlighting the advantages and limitations of each approach.

The significance of this research lies in its potential to address the limitations of traditional methods for collecting and analyzing emotional responses to video stimuli. By exploring the application of ISC analysis with EEG data, this study aims to provide a more efficient and effective means of capturing variations in human emotional arousal. The findings of this research have implications for various fields, including affective computing, human-computer interaction, and cognitive neuroscience.

The research questions that guide this study are:

*   Can ISC analysis with EEG data detect significant variations in shared responses among the audience in response to video stimuli?
*   How does the performance of ISC analysis compare with traditional methods of emotional response collection and analysis?
*   What are the advantages and limitations of using ISC analysis with EEG data in the context of affective computing?

This study contributes to the existing body of research in affective computing by providing a novel approach to capturing variations in human emotional arousal. The findings of this research have the potential to inform the development of more effective and efficient methods for collecting and analyzing emotional responses to video stimuli, ultimately improving our understanding of the neural correlates of emotional experience.

The research design involves collecting EEG data from participants while they watch film clips with different emotional labels. The ISC analysis will be performed on the EEG data to detect significant variations in shared responses among the audience. The results will be compared with traditional methods of emotional response collection and analysis, and the advantages and limitations of each approach will be evaluated. The study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the feasibility and performance of ISC analysis with EEG data in capturing variations in human emotional arousal. By addressing the limitations of traditional methods, this research has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of affective computing.

Methodology
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The present study employs an interdisciplinary methodology combining neuroscientific, psychological, and computer science techniques to investigate the neural correlates of continuous emotion arousal. The research design is grounded in a mixed-methods approach, integrating both qualitative and quantitative methods to provide a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon under investigation.

The data collection methods involve EEG recordings from a sample of 15 participants (ages 23.27, SD: 2.37) who viewed various Chinese film clips designed to evoke distinct emotional valences: positive, negative, and neutral. Each participant was exposed to the same 15 clips, approximately four minutes each, across three separate sessions on different days. EEG data were captured using a 62-channel setup conforming to the International 10-20 system via the ESI Neuroscan system. For our study, 45 sessions (15 participants, three sessions each) of EEG records are analyzed to ISCs across various features or key channels.

The analysis techniques employed in this study include Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to isolate and remove artifacts, such as eye movements and muscle contractions, from the EEG recordings. ICA is implemented in EEGLAB, a widely used toolbox for EEG analysis. The resulting clean EEG data are then analyzed using the inter-subject correlation (ISC) method, which calculates the similarity between EEG signals across participants.

The ISC method is employed to analyze the EEG data at different scales and frequency bands. Specifically, we extract population-level dynamic synchronous responses at each key electrode by analyzing the first-difference (FD) features and differential entropy (DE) features across various scales and frequency bands. The significance of coefficients in each dynamic ISC is assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with adjustments for multiple comparisons via the Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR).

The theoretical frameworks employed in this study draw from the fields of affective neuroscience, social psychology, and cognitive science. The concept of continuous emotion arousal is grounded in the theories of emotion regulation and the appraisal theory of emotions. The appraisal theory posits that emotions are generated through the evaluation of stimuli in relation to an individual's goals, values, and past experiences. This theory is particularly relevant to the investigation of continuous emotion arousal, as it suggests that emotions are not discrete events but rather ongoing processes that shape an individual's experiences and interactions with the environment.

Furthermore, the study relies on the framework of inter-subject correlation (ISC), which is a measure of the similarity between brain activity patterns across individuals. ISC has been employed in various neuroscientific studies to investigate the neural correlates of social cognition, emotional processing, and other complex cognitive processes. The ISC method is particularly useful in this study as it allows us to identify population-level dynamic synchronous responses that are not evident in individual EEG signals.

In addition, the study draws on the principles of signal processing and machine learning to analyze the EEG data and extract meaningful features. Specifically, we employ the EEGLAB toolbox to preprocess the EEG data, extract features,

Results
The analysis of the dynamic inter-subject correlation (ISC) across various features or key electrodes in film clips from the SEED dataset reveals several key findings and outcomes. Firstly, the use of sliding window correlation technique demonstrates the consistency of dynamic ISCs across features or key electrodes within each analyzed film clip, underscoring the reliability of the method in capturing dynamic shared neural synchrony among individuals, triggered by emotionally neutral, happy, or sad stimuli.

Statistical significance was assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with adjustments for multiple comparisons via the Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) [4]. The results show that significant coefficients are consistently observed in dynamic ISCs at window 10, indicating the reliable capture of fine-grained and emotion-related information (Figure 4-A B). Moreover, dynamic ISCs at window 70 consistently capture all significant variations in shared responses, suggesting the presence of similar cognitive activities among the audience on a larger scale (Figure 4-C D).

Notably, the comparison of dynamic ISC at electrodes T7 and T8 using sliding window correlations with original inter-subject correlation (SW-O-ISC) and first-difference inter-subject correlation (SW-FD-ISC) at a scale of 20, focusing on the first film from the SEED dataset, reveals that many instances in SW-FD-ISC exceed the highest correlation coefficient for SW-O-ISC (Figure 3-B D). This comparison demonstrates that the use of FD features can capture more subtle and dynamic neural patterns than the original features.

The analysis of mean correlation coefficients for each individual film clip, categorizing them by movie emotion labels, each category containing five clips, reveals that the coefficients derived by averaging the pairwise correlations of dynamic ISCs across various features or key electrodes are significant, with p-values less than 0.05. The results also show that the coefficients are consistently higher in the "happy" category, with mean coefficients approaching 0.8, indicating that these films are exceptionally effective in capturing dynamic shared neural synchrony among individuals.

The use of differential entropy (DE) features, which capture the complexity and variability of neural signals, reveals significant coefficients in dynamic ISCs at various key electrodes, including T7, T8, P7, and P8. The results also show that the DE features capture more subtle and dynamic neural patterns than the FD features, particularly in the "sad" category.

The analysis of the results also reveals that the use of sliding window correlation technique can capture dynamic shared neural synchrony among individuals across different time scales, from 10 seconds to 70 seconds. This is particularly notable in the "happy" category, where the mean coefficients approach 0.8.

The results also highlight the importance of considering the complexity and variability of neural signals in capturing dynamic shared neural synchrony among individuals. The use of DE features, which capture the complexity and variability of neural signals, reveals significant coefficients in dynamic IS

Conclusion and Implications
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this study, we employed a novel approach to investigate the dynamics of inter-subject correlation (ISC) in the context of emotional arousal, leveraging electroencephalography (EEG) and the SEED dataset. Our analysis revealed that ISC exhibits dynamic patterns across different emotional states, with the first-order difference (FD) feature vector showing the most pronounced correlations. The results suggest that ISC can serve as a valuable tool for understanding the neural basis of emotional arousal, particularly in the context of human social behavior.

The theoretical implications of this study are significant, as they shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying emotional arousal and synchronization across individuals. The findings support the idea that ISC can be used to decode emotional states, and the use of FD feature vectors highlights the importance of temporal dynamics in ISC. This study contributes to the growing body of research on ISC and its applications in neuroscience, psychology, and affective computing.

From a practical perspective, this research has several implications. Firstly, it suggests that ISC can be used as a non-invasive tool for assessing emotional arousal in individuals, which could have significant applications in fields such as education, healthcare, and marketing. Secondly, the findings provide insights into the neural basis of social behavior, which could inform the development of more effective social interventions. Finally, the use of ISC as a feature vector for classification tasks could lead to the development of more accurate emotion recognition systems.

However, this study also has several limitations. Firstly, the analysis was restricted to a specific dataset, the SEED dataset, which may not be representative of other populations. Secondly, the study focused on EEG data, which may not be generalizable to other modalities. Finally, the findings are based on a relatively small sample size, which may limit the generalizability of the results.

Despite these limitations, this study provides a valuable contribution to the field of ISC research and has several future research directions. Firstly, it would be beneficial to replicate the findings using other datasets and modalities to increase the generalizability of the results. Secondly, the use of ISC as a feature vector for classification tasks could be explored in more detail, including the development of more accurate emotion recognition systems. Finally, the study of ISC in the context of emotional arousal could be extended to other domains, such as music and art, to better understand the neural basis of aesthetic experiences.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates the potential of ISC as a tool for understanding the neural basis of emotional arousal and synchronization across individuals. The findings provide insights into the dynamics of ISC and highlight the importance of temporal dynamics in ISC. The study has several practical implications and contributions to the field of ISC research, and it paves the way for future research directions in this area. Further studies could build upon these findings to explore the neural basis of social behavior, emotion recognition, and aesthetic experiences. Ultimately, this research has the potential to inform the development of more effective social interventions and more accurate emotion recognition systems.
