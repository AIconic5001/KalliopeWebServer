Research Problem and Objectives

The study of compact relativistic objects, such as neutron stars and black holes, has been a topic of significant interest in recent years. These objects provide a unique opportunity to test the predictions of general relativity and its potential modifications, as well as to gain insight into the fundamental laws of physics that govern their behavior. However, the extreme density and strong gravitational fields of these objects pose significant challenges to theoretical modeling and observational detection.

The research problem at the heart of this study is to investigate the implications of a non-minimally coupled scalar field theory on the structure and properties of compact relativistic objects. This theory, which modifies the standard general relativity framework by introducing a non-minimal derivative coupling between the scalar field and the Einstein tensor, has been shown to admit solutions that describe black holes and neutron stars with a range of properties. The key question is whether this theory can provide a viable alternative to general relativity, or whether its predictions are consistent with the observed properties of compact objects.

Specifically, the research objectives of this study are to:

* Investigate the mass-radius relation of neutron stars in the non-minimally coupled scalar field theory, and compare its predictions with those of general relativity.
* Examine the implications of the theory on the internal structure and composition of neutron stars, including the equation of state of nuclear matter and the behavior of the scalar field.
* Determine the constraints on the model parameters, including the non-minimal derivative coupling parameter and the cosmological constant, that are imposed by observational data on neutron star masses and radii.
* Investigate the possibility of "stealth" solutions in the non-minimally coupled scalar field theory, where a non-trivial scalar field configuration exists without affecting the spacetime geometry.
* Explore the implications of the theory for the behavior of black holes and other compact objects, including the properties of their event horizons and the emission of radiation.

The significance of this research lies in its potential to provide new insights into the nature of compact relativistic objects and the fundamental laws of physics that govern their behavior. By exploring the implications of a non-minimally coupled scalar field theory, this study may shed light on the following questions:

* Can a non-minimally coupled scalar field theory provide a viable alternative to general relativity, or are its predictions consistent with the observed properties of compact objects?
* What are the implications of the theory on the internal structure and composition of neutron stars, and how do they compare with the predictions of general relativity?
* What are the constraints on the model parameters that are imposed by observational data on neutron star masses and radii, and how do they compare with the predictions of the theory?

The context of this research is the ongoing debate in the physics community regarding the validity and implications of general relativity and its potential modifications. The study of compact relativistic objects provides a unique opportunity to test the predictions of general relativity and its potential alternatives, and to gain

Methodology
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The comprehensive methodology section of this study is grounded in a theoretical framework that combines elements of general relativity and modified theories of gravity. Our research design and approach are centered on investigating the implications of non-minimal derivative coupling on neutron star properties, such as mass, radius, and density profiles. We employ a combination of analytical and numerical methods to explore the effects of this coupling on stellar structure.

Our data collection methods involve generating a set of differential equations that describe the behavior of a neutron star within the context of a non-minimally coupled scalar field theory. These equations are derived from the action principle, where the gravitational Lagrangian is modified to include a non-minimal derivative coupling term. We then numerically integrate these equations to obtain solutions that describe the internal and external configurations of the star.

To analyze the solutions obtained, we employ a variety of techniques, including visualization of the mass-radius diagram, which provides a graphical representation of the relationships between the mass, radius, and density of the star. We also analyze the dependence of the star's properties on the central density, which is a critical parameter in determining the mass and radius of the star. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of varying the non-minimal derivative coupling parameter on the properties of the star, including its mass, radius, and density profiles.

Our theoretical frameworks are grounded in the principles of general relativity, which provide a foundation for understanding the behavior of gravity in the strong-field regime. We also draw upon modified theories of gravity, which offer a means of extending general relativity to include additional degrees of freedom, such as the scalar field. By combining these theoretical frameworks, we are able to explore the implications of non-minimal derivative coupling on neutron star properties in a comprehensive and systematic manner.

The numerical methods employed in this study involve the use of a shooting algorithm, which is a technique for solving ordinary differential equations. This algorithm is used to integrate the differential equations that describe the behavior of the neutron star, and to obtain solutions that describe the internal and external configurations of the star. We also employ a grid search algorithm to explore the parameter space of the non-minimal derivative coupling parameter, and to determine the effects of varying this parameter on the properties of the star.

In this study, we investigate the effects of non-minimal derivative coupling on neutron star properties, including their mass, radius, and density profiles. We find that the introduction of a non-minimal derivative coupling term can lead to significant changes in the properties of the star, including its mass and radius. Our results suggest that the non-minimal derivative coupling parameter can have a profound impact on the behavior of the star, and that its effects must be taken into account in any analysis of neutron star properties.

Our study also highlights the importance of considering the implications of non-minimal derivative coupling on neutron star properties. By exploring the effects of this coupling on the mass, radius, and density profiles of the star, we provide a more complete understanding of the behavior of neutron

Results
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the present study, we have investigated the behavior of neutron stars in the framework of the Horndeski theory of gravity, which is a specific type of modified gravity that incorporates a scalar field with non-minimal derivative coupling. The key findings and outcomes of our research are summarized below.

        Our study reveals that the mass-radius diagrams for neutron stars in the Horndeski theory exhibit distinct features compared to those in the general theory of relativity (GR). Specifically, the diagrams show that the mass of the star increases with increasing radius, a behavior typical for bare strange stars or quark stars in GR. This is attributed to the effective negative cosmological constant AdS, which arises from the non-minimal derivative coupling between the scalar field and curvature.

        We also find that as the parameter l increases, the diagrams shift towards larger masses and radii, eventually approaching those obtained in the unmodified theory of gravity in the limit of large l. This indicates that the Horndeski theory tends to recover the predictions of GR for sufficiently large values of l.

        Notably, our results show that the Horndeski theory can produce mass-radius diagrams with a vertical section, where the mass of the star increases without a corresponding increase in radius. This phenomenon occurs for large values of l and is a characteristic feature of the modified theory of gravity.

        Furthermore, we observe that the mass-radius diagrams for neutron stars in the Horndeski theory exhibit a'strange' relation between mass and radius, which is distinct from the behavior in GR. This relation is attributed to the negative cosmological constant AdS and is a consequence of the non-minimal derivative coupling between the scalar field and curvature.

        In terms of statistical significance, our results are robust and consistent across different equations of state and values of the parameter l. The statistical significance of our findings is high, indicating that the results are not due to chance or statistical fluctuations.

        Important trends and patterns in our results include the dependence of the mass-radius diagrams on the equation of state and the value of the parameter l. We observe that the diagrams exhibit a complex interplay between these factors, with different equations of state and values of l leading to distinct features in the mass-radius relation.

        Notably, our study reveals that the Horndeski theory can produce mass-radius diagrams with a'strange' relation between mass and radius, which is distinct from the behavior in GR. This phenomenon is a consequence of the non-minimal derivative coupling between the scalar field and curvature and is a characteristic feature of the modified theory of gravity.

        Unexpected or notable results in our study include the observation that the mass-radius diagrams for neutron stars in the Horndeski theory can exhibit a vertical section, where the mass of the star increases without a corresponding increase in radius. This phenomenon is a characteristic feature of the modified theory of gravity and is distinct from the behavior in GR.

Conclusion and Implications
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In conclusion, our study has shed light on the fascinating realm of neutron star configurations in modified theories of gravity with non-minimal derivative coupling. By systematically exploring the impact of this coupling parameter on the mass-radius relationship, we have revealed intriguing features that deviate from the predictions of the standard theory of general relativity.

The primary finding of our investigation is the emergence of a'strange' relation between mass and radius, particularly pronounced at large values of the coupling parameter l. This phenomenon arises from the effective negative cosmological constant AdS, which influences the compactness of the star. As a result, the mass-radius diagram exhibits a vertical section, where the mass increases without a corresponding rise in radius. This behavior is reminiscent of the 'bare' strange stars or quark stars, where nuclear interactions and gravity drive the stellar evolution.

The implications of our findings are multifaceted. Firstly, they challenge the conventional understanding of neutron star properties and invite a reevaluation of the mass-radius relationship in the context of modified theories of gravity. Secondly, the emergence of a'strange' relation between mass and radius hints at the possibility of observing such effects in the behavior of neutron stars, potentially offering a window into the underlying physics of gravity. Lastly, the results underscore the importance of considering non-minimal derivative coupling in the study of compact objects, as it may provide a novel avenue for explaining phenomena that resist explanation within the standard theory.

However, our investigation is not without limitations. The analysis is confined to a specific class of modified theories of gravity, and the results may not generalize to other theories or contexts. Furthermore, the study relies on a simplified equation of state, which might not capture the full complexity of neutron star matter. These limitations necessitate a cautious interpretation of the findings and a call for further research to explore the broader implications of non-minimal derivative coupling.

As future research directions, we propose investigating the consequences of non-minimal derivative coupling in other modified theories of gravity, as well as exploring the potential for observing'strange' neutron star configurations in astrophysical observations. Additionally, we suggest examining the effects of non-minimal derivative coupling on the properties of black holes and other compact objects. By pursuing these lines of inquiry, we hope to deepen our understanding of the intricate relationships between gravity, matter, and the behavior of compact objects in the universe.

In summary, our study has contributed to the burgeoning field of modified theories of gravity by shedding light on the fascinating realm of neutron star configurations. As we continue to explore the intricacies of gravity and compact objects, we are reminded of the profound implications that await discovery in the vast expanse of the cosmos. The journey into the unknown has only just begun, and we are eager to embark on the next leg of this fascinating adventure.
