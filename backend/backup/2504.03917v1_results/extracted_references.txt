concept of neutron stars was proposed by Baade and Zwigi in 1932 [1] and was discovered many years later in 1967 as rapidly rotating stars with strong magnetic fields, now known as pulsars [2]. Since the discovery of neutron stars, methods for observing them have been improved, and knowledge about their nature have been changed. A detailed discussion of the properties of neutron stars can be found in the following monographs and reviews [3-9]. Neutron stars belong to the class of compact stars, as the

Fig. 3d shows the dependence of the sound speedv2/c2 on the density for BSk24 equation of state. Apparently in the case caus equation of state do not give a complete description, causality breaks down, in particular it was discussed in [73]. 2.3 Boundary conditions The equations (2.4)-(2.6) form a closed system of ordinary differential equations for function A(r), B(r)

The permissible values of are limited by the area of applicability equation of state and its analytical representation. In particular, for the BSk24 equation, the authors consider the following range of densities106 g/cm3 1016 g/cm3. Also some equations of state give the superluminal speed of sound above critical

stars, as the white dwarfs and quark stars [10], which are so far undetected. It is generally accepted that a canonical neutron star has a massM = 1.4 M and radiusR = 10 km. Stars of such extreme compactness have central densities that are 5-10 times the nuclear saturation densitysat = 2.8 x 1014 g cm-3. The nature of such matter is still not clear, and there are various models to describe it. The structure of relativistic stars and their mass-radius relation are determined by integrating the relativistic

Twenty years ago, estimates of the mass of radio pulsars showed a narrow distribution interval of about1.35 0.04 M [13]. Thanks to more recent studies [14, 15], - 1 - we know now that neutron star masses span a wide range, between 1.2 and at least 2M . It was found evidence for neutron stars with more than two and almost three Solar masses. The review the most massive neutron stars presently known in light of recent findings can be found in [16]. Typically obtained radii are in the range 10-14 km [14]. For

the relativistic structure equations, also known as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations [11, 12]. The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations connect such macroscopic parameters of a star as mass and radius with microphysics, which is described by the equation of state of superdense matter. The maximum neutron star mass is very important to distinguish between black holes and massive neutron stars and is a crucial parameter in studying the equation of state of cold dense matter.
