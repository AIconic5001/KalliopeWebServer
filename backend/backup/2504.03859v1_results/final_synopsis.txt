Research Problem and Objectives

Financial forecasting is a crucial aspect of investment and risk management, requiring accurate predictions of future financial outcomes. However, traditional financial forecasting methods often suffer from limitations such as over-reliance on historical data, neglect of uncertainty, and failure to account for asymmetric distributions. To address these challenges, this research proposes the development and evaluation of novel Bayesian modal regression models for financial forecasting, focusing on quarterly revenue forecasting for technology companies.

The research problem at hand is the need for more robust and accurate financial forecasting methods that can effectively capture the complexities and uncertainties inherent in financial data. Traditional methods, such as mean and median regression, have limitations in accounting for asymmetric error distributions, leading to biased estimates and suboptimal decision-making. In contrast, modal regression offers a promising approach, as it can capture the mode of the data, which is often more informative than the mean or median, particularly when dealing with skewed and asymmetric distributions.

The specific research objectives of this study are:

1. To develop and implement Bayesian modal regression models for financial forecasting, focusing on quarterly revenue forecasting for technology companies.
2. To evaluate the performance of the proposed Bayesian modal regression models in comparison to traditional mean and median regression methods.
3. To investigate the impact of different error distributions, including asymmetric Laplace, asymmetric normal, and reverse Gumbel distributions, on the performance of the proposed models.
4. To examine the effect of incorporating prior knowledge and external information on the forecasting performance of the proposed models.

To achieve these objectives, this research will address the following research questions:

1. Can Bayesian modal regression models outperform traditional mean and median regression methods in financial forecasting, particularly when dealing with skewed and asymmetric error distributions?
2. How do different error distributions affect the performance of the proposed Bayesian modal regression models?
3. Can the incorporation of prior knowledge and external information improve the forecasting performance of the proposed Bayesian modal regression models?

The significance of this research lies in its potential to provide more accurate and robust financial forecasting methods that can effectively capture the complexities and uncertainties inherent in financial data. The proposed Bayesian modal regression models have the potential to improve decision-making in investment and risk management, particularly in the technology sector. By investigating the impact of different error distributions and the incorporation of prior knowledge, this research aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing financial forecasting performance.

In the context of the technology sector, this research is particularly relevant, as quarterly revenue forecasting is a critical aspect of investment and risk management. The proposed Bayesian modal regression models have the potential to provide more accurate predictions of future financial outcomes, enabling investors and risk managers to make more informed decisions. The research findings will contribute to the development of more effective financial forecasting methods, ultimately leading to improved decision-making and reduced uncertainty in investment and risk management.

The research will be conducted using a combination of theoretical and empirical approaches. The theoretical development of the proposed Bayesian modal regression models will be based on the principles of Bayesian statistics and modal regression. Empirical evaluation

Methodology
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The methodology employed in this research is a Bayesian inferential framework, specifically designed to address the challenges of asymmetric loss functions in financial forecasting. This approach provides a more comprehensive and principled framework for modeling uncertainty and performing predictive inference.

Our research design and approach are grounded in the Bayesian inferential framework, which allows us to incorporate prior knowledge and compensate for limited data. This is particularly relevant in financial forecasting, where data is often scarce and subject to significant uncertainty. By utilizing a Bayesian approach, we can leverage prior knowledge and expertise to inform our forecasting models, reducing the risk of biased or inaccurate predictions.

Data collection methods involve the use of quarterly revenue data from the Institutional Brokers' Estimate System (I/B/E/S) within the Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS). Our sample consists of 23 technology companies across the years 2015 through 2023, providing a rich source of data for analysis. The dataset includes the ground truth quarterly revenues with corresponding one-quarter-ahead analyst forecasts, allowing us to evaluate the performance of our forecasting models.

Analysis techniques employed in this research include the use of modal regression, which is a Bayesian approach to modeling central tendency. Modal regression provides several advantages over mean and median regression, including robustness to skewed and heavy-tailed distributions, narrower predictive intervals, and better interpretability. By utilizing modal regression, we can identify the most probable outcome, making it more robust in settings where outliers are common.

Theoretical frameworks employed in this research include the concept of asymmetric loss functions, which is a fundamental aspect of financial forecasting. Asymmetric loss functions arise when overestimation and underestimation carry different penalties, requiring decision-makers to operate under uncertain and dynamic environments. By accounting for these complexities, our Bayesian inferential framework provides a more comprehensive and principled approach to modeling uncertainty and performing predictive inference.

Furthermore, our research utilizes the concept of modal regression to address the challenges of asymmetric loss functions. Modal regression is a Bayesian approach to modeling central tendency, providing several advantages over mean and median regression. By identifying the most probable outcome, modal regression can be more robust in settings where outliers are common, and it can provide narrower predictive intervals and better interpretability.

Our analysis also draws on the concept of hierarchical modal regression models, which is a Bayesian approach to modeling complex relationships between variables. Hierarchical modal regression models allow us to capture the nuances of financial forecasting, including the interactions between different variables and the impact of external factors on forecasting outcomes.

In terms of analysis techniques, we utilize a range of methods to evaluate the performance of our forecasting models. These include the use of metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared, which provide a comprehensive picture of model performance. We also employ techniques such as cross-validation and rolling window analysis to ensure the robustness and generalizability of our findings.

In addition, our research draws on the concept of Bayesian inference to inform our forecasting models. Bayesian inference provides a probabilistic

Results
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our simulation study presents the following key findings and outcomes. Across the various error distributions, we observe that our proposed Bayesian modal regression models perform well in forecasting quarterly revenue. The hit rates of the models are high, ranging from 80% to 90%, indicating that our models can accurately predict the most likely revenue outcome. In comparison, mean regression with normally distributed errors achieves a hit rate of around 60%, which is significantly lower than our models. This result suggests that our models are robust to outliers and can handle the asymmetry and fat tails present in the error distributions. Furthermore, our models exhibit narrower predictive intervals than mean regression, indicating that our models provide more precise forecasts.

        The coverage of our 95% credible intervals for the models is close to 0.95, indicating that our models are reliable in predicting the true revenue outcome. The Monte Carlo standard error (MCSE) of our models is low, indicating that our models are stable and not prone to overfitting. Our models also exhibit a high win rate, indicating that our models can accurately predict the revenue outcome when it is above or below the forecast.

        One notable result is that our models perform well even when the error distribution is asymmetric and fat-tailed. This suggests that our models are robust to the non-normality of the error distributions and can handle the skewness and excess kurtosis present in the data. Our models also exhibit a high hit rate when the error distribution is symmetric, indicating that our models can handle the normal case.

        However, our study also reveals some limitations. The choice of prior distribution for the parameter affects the performance of our models. A Beta(2, 2) prior distribution is chosen for since there is limited asymmetry in the residual plots. This choice gives slightly more weight when is closer to 0.5. Our study also reveals that the posterior predictive distribution (PPD) plots for specific tickers fluctuate over time and contain asymmetry. This suggests that our models should be used with caution when making predictions for specific tickers.

        Our study also highlights the importance of using modal regression over mean and median regression. Modal regression provides more robust forecasts, narrower predictive intervals, and better interpretability. This is particularly important in financial forecasting where outliers are common and the error distributions are often non-normal.

        In conclusion, our simulation study demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed Bayesian modal regression models in forecasting quarterly revenue. Our models perform well even when the error distribution is asymmetric and fat-tailed, and exhibit a high hit rate and win rate. Our study also highlights the importance of using modal regression over mean and median regression, and reveals some limitations in the choice of prior distribution and the PPD plots. Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the use of modal regression in financial forecasting and highlights the need for further research in this area.

Conclusion and Implications
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In conclusion, this study presents a comprehensive exploration of modal regression for financial forecasting, leveraging the asymmetric Laplace, asymmetric normal, and reverse Gumbel error distributions. Our findings demonstrate the superiority of modal regression over mean and median regression in terms of robustness, predictive intervals, and interpretability. The rolling window cross-validation procedure allowed us to assess the performance of these models under various scenarios, revealing that modal regression achieved higher average hit and win rates than mean regression with normally distributed errors. This suggests that some degree of asymmetry and fat tails may be present in the error distributions, aligning with previous parameter estimates from our previous paper.

        Theoretical and practical implications of our study are multifaceted. Firstly, the results underscore the importance of considering asymmetric error distributions in financial forecasting, rather than relying on symmetric assumptions. This is particularly relevant in times of market uncertainty, where fat-tailed distributions are more likely to occur. Secondly, the findings highlight the benefits of modal regression in capturing the most likely or probable value, rather than the mean or median. This is crucial in financial forecasting, where uncertainty in parameter estimates can significantly impact predictive inference.

        The study also has practical implications for financial institutions and investment firms. By adopting modal regression, these organizations can improve their forecasting accuracy and make more informed investment decisions. Moreover, the results of our study can inform the development of more robust financial models, which can better withstand market shocks and uncertainties.

        Despite the contributions of this study, there are limitations that warrant consideration. Firstly, the use of a rolling window cross-validation procedure may introduce biases, particularly if the window size is too small. Secondly, the choice of error distribution may not be universally applicable, and further research is needed to explore other distributions. Finally, the study focuses on a specific dataset, and future research should aim to replicate the findings using different datasets and scenarios.

        Future research directions are numerous. Firstly, it would be beneficial to explore other error distributions, such as the skewed normal or Student's t distribution, to determine their suitability for financial forecasting. Secondly, the study could be extended to include more complex financial models, such as those incorporating macroeconomic variables or time-varying parameter combinations. Lastly, the development of more robust modal regression algorithms, capable of handling large datasets and complex scenarios, would be a valuable contribution to the field of financial forecasting. By addressing these limitations and exploring new research directions, future studies can build upon the findings of this research and provide even more accurate and reliable financial forecasts. Ultimately, the results of this study demonstrate the potential of modal regression in improving financial forecasting accuracy and inform the development of more robust financial models. By adopting a more nuanced approach to error distributions and central tendency, financial institutions and investment firms can make more informed investment decisions and better navigate the complexities of financial markets.
