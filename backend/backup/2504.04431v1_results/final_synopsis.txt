Research Problem and Objectives
        The study of non-Hermitian systems has led to the discovery of various novel phenomena, including the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), which arises from the unique point-gap topology inherent in non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. The NHSE has been experimentally observed in various platforms, including acoustic and optical systems. However, the exploration of dislocation-induced NHSE in defective topological systems remains an open question. This research aims to investigate the dislocation-induced NHSE in defective topological systems and its implications for the study of non-Hermitian systems.

        The research problem is centered around the observation and characterization of dislocation-induced NHSE in defective topological systems. Specifically, we aim to investigate the effects of dislocations on the sound energy distribution in a toroidal acoustic lattice with two dislocations. Our research is motivated by the need to understand the behavior of dislocations in defective topological systems and their impact on the non-Hermitian skin effect. The study of dislocation-induced NHSE is significant because it provides a unique platform for exploring the interplay between topological defects and non-Hermitian systems.

        The research objectives are multifaceted and can be summarized as follows: (1) to experimentally observe the dislocation-induced NHSE in a defective toroidal acoustic lattice with two dislocations; (2) to characterize the effects of dislocations on the sound energy distribution in the lattice; (3) to investigate the implications of dislocation-induced NHSE for the study of non-Hermitian systems; and (4) to explore the possibility of utilizing dislocation-induced NHSE as a means of controlling the sound energy distribution in defective topological systems.

        The research questions that guide this study are: (1) What is the effect of dislocations on the sound energy distribution in a defective toroidal acoustic lattice with two dislocations? (2) How does the dislocation-induced NHSE compare to the boundary-induced NHSE in the lattice? (3) What are the implications of dislocation-induced NHSE for the study of non-Hermitian systems? (4) Can dislocation-induced NHSE be utilized as a means of controlling the sound energy distribution in defective topological systems?

        The significance of this research lies in its potential to provide new insights into the behavior of dislocations in defective topological systems and their impact on the non-Hermitian skin effect. The study of dislocation-induced NHSE is expected to contribute significantly to the understanding of non-Hermitian systems and their applications in various fields, including acoustics, optics, and condensed matter physics. Furthermore, the exploration of dislocation-induced NHSE in defective topological systems has the potential to lead to the development of new technologies that can control the sound energy distribution in these systems.

Methodology
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The methodology employed in this research is based on an interdisciplinary approach that combines experimental and theoretical techniques to investigate the topological phenomena in non-Hermitian acoustic systems. Our research design and approach involve the creation of a defective, toroidal acoustic lattice with two dislocations, which is then used to study the boundary non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and the dislocation NHSE.

        The experimental setup consists of a passive cavity-tube structure that simulates a reciprocal acoustic lattice, and a set of active unidirectional couplers (UCs) that implement additional unidirectional couplings. A defect line, ending with two dislocations DL and DR, is created by removing four air-filled cavities from the layer of n 2. The sound energy density is measured across the entire sample using a microphone and an amplifier, and the transmission responses are obtained by fitting the measured data using coupled-mode theory.

        To counteract the influence of intrinsic loss, we evaluate the sound energy n, n |pf| for each cavity, and then renormalize the data as n, n n, n/n, n. This approach allows us to extract the uniform sound energy distribution in the reciprocal, torus-like acoustic lattice with two dislocations, and to compare it with the dislocation NHSE.

        Our data collection methods involve the measurement of sound energy density and transmission responses in the defective acoustic lattice with two dislocations. We use a combination of experimental and theoretical techniques to analyze the data, including coupled-mode theory and numerical simulations. The theoretical frameworks employed in this research are based on non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and their parent Hermitian Hamiltonians constructed via a doubling procedure.

        The analysis techniques used in this research involve the evaluation of the sound energy density and transmission responses in the defective acoustic lattice with two dislocations. We use coupled-mode theory to analyze the data and to compare it with the expected uniform distribution in the absence of non-reciprocity. We also use numerical simulations to verify the experimental results and to explore the topological phenomena in non-Hermitian acoustic systems.

        The theoretical frameworks employed in this research are based on non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and their parent Hermitian Hamiltonians constructed via a doubling procedure. This approach allows us to connect the topological phenomena in non-Hermitian systems with the topological invariants of their Hermitian counterparts. The parent Hermitian Hamiltonian H is constructed by doubling the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian H, and it shares the same algebraic properties as H. This connection provides a deeper understanding of the topological phenomena in non-Hermitian systems and allows us to explore the interaction between nontrivial defects and point-gap topology.

        Our research has significant implications for the study of topological phenomena in non-Hermitian systems, including the boundary NHSE and the dislocation NHSE. We demonstrate that the dislocation NHSE can be

Results
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The results of this study provide a comprehensive understanding of the dislocation non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in defective, toroidal acoustic systems. The key findings and outcomes of this research are summarized below.

        The first experimental observation of dislocation NHSE is reported, demonstrating a striking phenomenon where a large number of states accumulate toward open boundaries. The dislocation NHSE is characterized by a rapid accumulation of sound energy density around the dislocation DL and a dramatic depletion near the dislocation DR. This is a unique feature of dislocation NHSE, distinguishing it from the conventional boundary NHSE. The probability density distribution of eigenstates also exhibits distinctive features of dislocation NHSE, including a rapid accumulation around DL and a dramatic depletion near DR.

        The renormalized sound energy density, which counteracts the influence of intrinsic loss, closely matches the expected uniform distribution in the absence of non-reciprocity. This indicates that the dislocation NHSE is not a result of the intrinsic loss but rather a genuine phenomenon arising from the interplay between non-reciprocity and topological defects. Furthermore, the experimental data reproduce well the numerical results based on coupled-mode theory, providing strong evidence for the dislocation NHSE.

        The dislocation NHSE is found to be robust against variations in the system parameters, such as the hopping parameters and the dislocation strength. This indicates that the dislocation NHSE is a robust and universal phenomenon, independent of the specific details of the system. The dislocation NHSE is also found to be sensitive to the topology of the system, with the dislocation DL and DR exhibiting distinct morphologies of eigenstates.

        The results of this study also highlight the importance of understanding the interplay between non-reciprocity and topological defects in defective, toroidal acoustic systems. The dislocation NHSE is a novel phenomenon that arises from this interplay, and its study provides new insights into the behavior of sound in such systems.

        The limitations of this research include the assumption of a uniform lattice structure and the neglect of higher-order skin effects. Future studies should aim to relax these assumptions and investigate the effects of higher-order skin effects on the dislocation NHSE.

        In conclusion, this study provides the first experimental observation of dislocation NHSE in defective, toroidal acoustic systems. The results demonstrate a striking phenomenon where a large number of states accumulate toward open boundaries, characterized by a rapid accumulation of sound energy density around the dislocation DL and a dramatic depletion near the dislocation DR. The dislocation NHSE is found to be robust against variations in the system parameters and sensitive to the topology of the system. This study provides new insights into the behavior of sound in defective, toroidal acoustic systems and highlights the importance of understanding the interplay between non-reciprocity and topological defects. The results of this study also pave the way for future research into the effects of higher-order skin effects on the dislocation NHSE.

Moreover, the study focuses on a specific type of dislocation NHSE, and further research is needed to explore the diversity of dislocation NHSE phenomena and their topological origins. Additionally, the study is limited to acoustic lattices, and it remains to be seen whether dislocation NHSE can be observed in other types of systems, such as photonic or solid-state lattices.

Future research directions should aim to generalize the dislocation NHSE to various types of systems, exploring the universal features and topological origins of this phenomenon. Investigating the effects of different types of defects, such as edge or surface defects, and examining the interplay between dislocation NHSE and other non-Hermitian effects are also crucial directions. Furthermore, exploring the applications of dislocation NHSE in diverse fields, such as material science, optics, and quantum computing, will shed light on the vast potential of this phenomenon. By expanding our understanding of dislocation NHSE and its topological origins, we can unlock new avenues for wave and energy manipulation, leading to breakthroughs in various fields and transforming our understanding of complex systems. Ultimately, this study marks the beginning of a new era in the exploration of non-Hermitian effects and topological phenomena, inviting researchers to delve into the intricate world of complex systems and unlock their secrets.
