the sound signal in site 1 is picked up by a microphone, then modulated by an amplifier and a phase shifter, and finally output into the site 2 through a loudspeaker [59,60].) All acoustic parameters are calibrated by fitting the measured transmission spectra in these binary cavity-tube structures. As exemplified in Fig. 3(c), the experimental data for the three x-directed elementary structures are well reproduced using the same set of acoustic parameters, with the active unidirectional couplers either

the case without non-reciprocity ( 0). On the one hand, this provides an experimental basis and comparison for the subsequent nonreciprocal system; on the other hand, it allows us to assess the influence of intrinsic loss ( 45 Hz ), which often obscures the observation of NHSE [39,60]. To do this, we place a sound source at the position n, n 0,0 inside the cavity, and scan the sound responses across the sample. Figures 4(a) exemplifies the measured pressure spectra pf for the layer n 0 , where the

plot of the sound energy density ( ln) distributed within th is layer, along with the renormalized data (ln) that counteract the influence of intrinsic loss.

It shows that, although the eigens tates in this reciprocal system predict a uniform probability distribution, the undesired background loss results in a significant sound attenuation away from the source. To counteract this loss effect, we evaluate the sound energy n, n |pf| for each cavity, and then renormalize the data as n, n n, n/n, n , since, intuitively, the symmetric cavities experience identical losses [ 60].

in Fig. 4(b), the renormalized sound energy density (blue spheres) closely matches the expected uniform distribution (in the absence of non-reciprocity), in contrast to the approximately exponential decay observed in the original data (yellow spheres). Furthermore, Fig. 4(c) presents the renormalized sound energy dens ity distributed across the entire sample, again exhibiting a nearly uniform distribution. We now activate the feedback circuits to characterize the dislocation NHSE in our defective, toroidal

chains [ 58]. It can be described by the momentum-space Bloch Hamiltonian Hk, kt e t e 2t cos k, ( 1 ) where t represents the reci procal hopping in the y direction, while t and t correspond to the leftward and rightward hoppings in the x direction, respectively. Without loss of generality, we assume that the non-reciprocity t t / 1 , as 5 / 14 indicated by the rightward arrows in Fig. 2(a). Physically, the 2D WHN lattice can be viewed as a collection of 1D Hatano-Nelson chains with k -dependent real

It clearly exhibits a sound accumulation around the dislocation DL and a depletion near the dislocation DR, which correspond to a dislocation skin effect and a dislocation anti-skin effect, respectively.

Therefore, its full PBC complex-energy spectrum forms a series of closed loops (each displaced along the real-energy axis), while the OBC spectrum consists of real eigenvalues within these loops. This is exemplified in Fig. 2(b) for a uniform lattice of 2ll 60 30 sites, where the hopping parameters t 0.6 , t 1.4 , and t 0.3 . This nontrivial point-gap topology signals th e presence of rightward NHSE at the boundary [ 15,16], as shown in Fig. 2(c). More

It consists of a passive cavity-tube structure that simulates a reciprocal acoustic lattice, and a set of active unidirectional couplers (UCs) that implement additional unidirectional coup lings. A defect line, ending with two dislocations DL and DR, is created by removing four air-filled cavities from the layer of n 2. The pink star denotes the position of the sound source, and the cavities are numbered as in the inset. (b) Three x-directed binary cavity-tube

The most striking one is the dramatic energy accumulation and depletion occurring around the dislocation cores DL and DR, which correspond to the unique skin and anti-skin effects in our defective WHN lattice, respectively. To demonstrate this more clearly, in Figs. 5(b) and 5(c) we plot the renormalized sound energy densities across several representative
