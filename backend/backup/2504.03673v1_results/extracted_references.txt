The positional offsets of radio sources from the cataloged position are over-plotted on the ROTI map. Assuming an ionospheric layer at an altitude of 300 km, the source position in Geographic coordinates is evaluated as the vertical projection of the intersection point between the ionosphere and the line of sight to the

At 12:56 (UT), in the left panel of figure 2, the Hyperdrive calibration pipeline is not able to measure the offset of radio sources at the eastern region. This is because the offset is larger than a threshold 1 Forconversionfromthehyperdriveoutputstothepositionaloffsets, we use the method given in Jordan et al.

The large scale patch of high ROTI propagates to WA at around 13:00 (UT). Figure 2 shows the zoomed ROTI map around the MWA site measured with GNSS.

limited due to the fluctuations. Conversely, by measuring the position offsets, the radio interferometer can be available to monitor ionospheric activity. The MWA is a low-frequency radio interferometer (Tingay et al. 2013; Wayth et al. 2018). The MWA has been used for studying the ionosphere. Previous works used the refractive position offsets of several radio sources in the MWA's wide field of view for revealing spatial gradients in the Total Electron Content (TEC) (Loi et al. 2015a, 2015b, 2016a;

The figure 1 and figure 2 indicate that the plasma bubble extended to WA. Before the arrival of the plasma bubble, at 12:00 (UT), the ROTI is low. The median value of the offsets is roughly 0.1 arcmin at182MHz. This value is a typical value for the calm state of the ionosphere (Jordan et al. 2017). At 12:30 (UT), the strong ROTI appeared north of the MWA. The ROTI map might
