We define so in the correlation function F as the occupational skill requirement, indicating the relative importance of each skill s for the occupation o. A high so implies that skill s is particularly critical in o' production process. Within each nest s, the correlation in productivity across occupations is captured by the correlation coefficient s, as discussed earlier.

analysts, who assess the remaining descriptors in the O*NET dataset. The database includes 277 descriptors, each rated by importance, level, relevance, or extent. These descriptors are organized into nine broad categories: skills, abilities, knowl- edge, work activities, work context, experience/education levels required, job interests, work values, and work styles. For this study, we focus on 218 descriptors from the skills, abilities, knowledge, work activities, and work context categories, as they serve

Occupations

within-skill share, while s,B refers to the between-skill share. Equation (9) has a straightforward interpretation: occupational employment is the sum of workers in the occupation who use different skills. Furthermore, the employment of workers for each skill is the product of the within-skill employment share and the share of workers using that skill. Occupations with similar skill requirements are located close to each other in the skill space and tend to exhibit similar within-skill employment shares,
