Methodology
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The comprehensive methodology employed in this study involves a multi-faceted approach that integrates various research design and data analysis techniques to examine the impact of automation and AI on labor markets. The methodology is centered around a combination of econometric analysis and descriptive statistics to understand the effects of technological changes on occupational characteristics, skill requirements, and employment outcomes.

Research design and approach

This study adopts a comparative analysis approach, examining the period between 1980 and 2018 to capture the evolution of labor markets in response to automation and AI. The analysis focuses on the occupational skill requirements and technological exposures, which are derived from the O*NET database. The database provides comprehensive information on occupational characteristics, worker skills, and job requirements across various occupations.

Data collection methods

The primary data source for this study is the O*NET database, which offers a vast array of occupational descriptors, including skills, abilities, knowledge, work activities, and work context. The database is particularly useful for this study as it provides detailed information on occupational skill requirements and technological exposures. The data is collected through a rigorous process, involving the aggregation of responses from a diverse group of experts, including workers, supervisors, and subject matter experts.

Analysis techniques

To examine the impact of automation and AI on labor markets, this study employs a range of econometric analysis techniques, including principal component analysis (PCA), factor analysis, and panel regression analysis. The PCA is used to identify the underlying dimensions of occupational skill requirements, which are then used to construct the skill space. The factor analysis is employed to decompose the variance in automation and AI exposures into eigenshocks, allowing for a deeper understanding of the underlying drivers of technological changes.

The panel regression analysis is used to examine the impact of automation and AI on employment outcomes, including wages, employment rates, and labor force participation. The analysis is conducted using the PSID dataset, which provides a comprehensive longitudinal view of labor market outcomes. The regression models are estimated using the PPML estimator, which accounts for the heterogeneity in employment effects across demographic groups.

Theoretical frameworks employed

This study draws on various theoretical frameworks to understand the impact of automation and AI on labor markets. The main theoretical frameworks employed include the skill-biased technological change (SBTC) theory, which posits that technological advancements lead to a shift in labor demand towards high-skilled workers. The study also draws on the occupational choice theory, which suggests that workers adjust their educational and occupational choices in response to shifts in the skill premium.

Furthermore, this study incorporates the concept of technological exposureresponding to automation and AI shocks, combining their distribution with the estimated labor supply structure. The analysis provides a nuanced understanding of the impact of automation and AI on labor markets, highlighting the need for policymakers to consider the distributional consequences of technological changes.

The methodology employed in this study offers a comprehensive framework for understanding the impact of automation and AI on labor markets. The combination of econometric analysis, descriptive statistics, and theoretical

Results
Our research yields a comprehensive understanding of the labor market impacts of technological advancements in automation and AI. The key findings and outcomes of our study are presented below.

First, we find that the share of tasks within each occupation that are either automatable or AI-exposed is a strong predictor of occupational exposure to automation and AI. Our estimates suggest that approximately 6,000 tasks (roughly one-third of the total) can be performed by AI without human intervention. This classification provides a detailed perspective on the differing impacts of AI-driven technologies and the labor market.

Our results also indicate that the adoption of automation technologies has led to significant employment adjustments in the US labor market. Specifically, we find that occupations with higher automation exposure experience slower labor share declines, a phenomenon observed in numerous studies. Moreover, we find that the share of tasks that can be automated is positively correlated with the rate of labor share decline.

We also investigate the impact of AI adoption on employment and wages. Our results suggest that AI adoption has led to significant employment shifts, with occupations that are more exposed to AI experiencing a greater decline in employment. Furthermore, we find that the wage incidence of AI is positive, indicating that AI adoption has led to higher wages in occupations that are more exposed to AI.

Our study also decomposes the variance in empirical automation and AI exposures into eigenshocks and finds that both automation and AI are predominantly explained by eigenshocks associated with the smallest eigenvalues. This suggests that the adoption of automation and AI technologies is driven by a combination of technological and demographic factors.

We also examine the relationship between skill requirements and occupational exposure to automation and AI. Our results indicate that manual skills dominate occupational differentiation and largely determine substitution patterns. We also find that cognitive skills are highly portable between occupations, allowing workers to use them elsewhere without significant productivity loss.

Our study has several limitations. First, our analysis is based on a sample of US occupations and may not be generalizable to other countries. Second, our measures of automation and AI exposure are based on a specific dataset and may not capture the full range of technological advancements. Third, our analysis does not account for the potential impacts of technological adoption on worker productivity and job satisfaction.

Despite these limitations, our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the labor market impacts of technological advancements in automation and AI. Our findings have important implications for policymakers and business leaders seeking to navigate the changing landscape of work. By understanding the drivers of occupational exposure to automation and AI, policymakers can design targeted interventions to support workers and businesses affected by technological change. Similarly, businesses can use our results to inform their strategies for adapting to the changing demands of the labor market.

Overall, our study contributes to the growing body of research on the labor market impacts of technological change. By providing a detailed analysis of the drivers of occupational exposure to automation and AI, our study sheds light on the complex relationships between technological adoption, worker skills, and labor market outcomes. Our findings have important implications for policymakers,

Conclusion and Implications
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The findings of this study provide new insights into the distributional consequences of automation and AI on the labor market. The results show that automation exposure is strongly correlated with the decline in labor share and the growth of low-skill service jobs, which is consistent with the spectral analysis. The eigenshocks associated with the smallest eigenvalues are found to be the primary drivers of the variation in automation and AI exposures, indicating that the labor market is more susceptible to these technological changes.

The theoretical implications of this study are significant. The findings suggest that the distribution of shocks plays a crucial role in shaping the incidence of technological changes, and that the labor market's ability to absorb these changes is limited by its capacity to substitute across different skills. This challenges the conventional view that technological changes are primarily driven by aggregate factors such as productivity growth.

The practical implications of this study are also noteworthy. The findings suggest that policymakers should consider the distributional consequences of automation and AI when designing policies to mitigate the effects of technological change. By targeting specific skills and occupations, policymakers can help to reduce the incidence of wage inequality and promote more equitable labor market outcomes.

However, this study also has several limitations. The use of principal component analysis (PCA) to decompose the variation in automation and AI exposures may not capture the full complexity of the underlying relationships. Additionally, the study relies on aggregate data, which may not fully capture the heterogeneity of the labor market. Furthermore, the study assumes that the labor market is in a state of equilibrium, which may not be the case in reality.

Despite these limitations, this study provides a valuable contribution to the ongoing debate about the effects of automation and AI on the labor market. The findings suggest that policymakers should adopt a more nuanced approach to addressing the distributional consequences of technological change, one that takes into account the specific skills and occupations that are most vulnerable to displacement. Future research should seek to build on these findings by exploring the interactions between technological change and other factors that shape the labor market, such as education and training programs, immigration policies, and labor market institutions. By doing so, researchers can provide more accurate and comprehensive assessments of the impact of automation and AI on the labor market, and inform policymakers' decisions with more reliable evidence. The study also highlights the importance of considering the distributional consequences of technological change, which is crucial for promoting more equitable labor market outcomes. Overall, the findings of this study emphasize the need for policymakers to adopt a more nuanced approach to addressing the distributional consequences of technological change, and to consider the specific skills and occupations that are most vulnerable to displacement. This requires a more comprehensive understanding of the labor market, one that takes into account the complex interactions between technological change, education and training programs, immigration policies, and labor market institutions. By doing so, policymakers can help to mitigate the adverse effects of automation and AI, and promote more equitable labor market outcomes. The study's findings also have important implications for the design of policies aimed at mitigating the
