Research Problem and Objectives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The research problem investigated in this study is the empirical content of information design in sequential decision-making. The core objective is to characterize the restrictions imposed by the joint distribution over action sequences generated by optimal Bayesian behavior for some prior and information process. This involves understanding the interplay between the agent's prior beliefs, the information process, and the resulting action sequences.

To address this research problem, we aim to identify the empirical content of information design in sequential decision-making. Specifically, we seek to:

1. Develop a theoretical framework that characterizes the restrictions imposed by the joint distribution over action sequences generated by optimal Bayesian behavior for some prior and information process.
2. Investigate how the analyst can elicit information from choice data to determine whether an action sequence can be rationalized by optimal Bayesian behavior for some prior and information process.
3. Explore the implications of the empirical content of information design for understanding the behavior of agents in sequential decision-making environments.

To achieve these objectives, we will employ a combination of theoretical and empirical approaches. Theoretical work will focus on developing a characterization of the empirical content of information design, while empirical work will involve analyzing data from sequential decision-making environments to examine the implications of the theoretical results.

This research is significant because it has important implications for understanding the behavior of agents in sequential decision-making environments. By characterizing the empirical content of information design, we can better understand how agents make decisions in the presence of uncertainty and how information design can influence these decisions. This knowledge can be applied in various fields, including economics, finance, and management science, to improve decision-making and optimize outcomes.

The context of this research is the study of sequential decision-making, which has been a topic of interest in economics and finance for many years. The empirical content of information design is a key aspect of this research, as it provides a framework for understanding how agents make decisions in the presence of uncertainty and how information design can influence these decisions. By exploring the empirical content of information design, we can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms that drive decision-making in sequential environments.

This research will contribute to the existing literature on sequential decision-making and information design by providing a new perspective on the empirical content of information design. Specifically, we will:

1. Develop a theoretical framework that characterizes the restrictions imposed by the joint distribution over action sequences generated by optimal Bayesian behavior for some prior and information process.
2. Investigate how the analyst can elicit information from choice data to determine whether an action sequence can be rationalized by optimal Bayesian behavior for some prior and information process.
3. Explore the implications of the empirical content of information design for understanding the behavior of agents in sequential decision-making environments.

The research questions that guide this study are:

1. What are the restrictions imposed by the joint distribution over action sequences generated by optimal Bayesian behavior for some prior and information process?
2. How can the analyst elicit information from choice data to determine whether an action sequence can be rationalized by optimal Bayesian behavior for

Methodology
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The methodology employed in this study is a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches, aimed at providing a comprehensive understanding of the research problem.

Research design and approach
The study employs a sequential information structure, where the analyst observes a distribution of action sequences and seeks to rationalize them. The approach is based on the idea of deviation rules, which are used to identify the set of distributions that can be rationalized. The analyst starts by defining the notion of domination in the sequential model, and then proceeds to characterize the family of distributions over action sequences that can be rationalized.

Data collection methods
The data collection methods employed in this study involve the observation of action sequences and the associated realized states for a large number of decision problems. The analyst collects data on the choices made by the agent in each period, as well as the signals received by the agent in each period. The data is then used to construct the distribution of action sequences that can be rationalized.

Analysis techniques
The analysis techniques employed in this study involve the use of deviation rules to identify the set of distributions that can be rationalized. The analyst uses the notion of apparent dominance to identify sequences of actions that can be dominated by another sequence of actions. The analyst then uses the notion of true dominance to identify sequences of actions that cannot be rationalized. The analysis is conducted using a combination of mathematical and econometric techniques.

Theoretical frameworks employed
The theoretical frameworks employed in this study are based on the concepts of sequential information structure and deviation rules. The study draws on the work of Bergemann and Morris [2019] and Bergemann, Brooks, and Morris [2022], who provide a unified perspective on information design. The study also draws on the work of Forges [1986] and Myerson [1986], who provide a framework for understanding communication equilibria. The study uses the concepts of Bayes correlated equilibrium and rationalizable strategic behavior to understand the dynamics of decision-making under uncertainty.

In addition to these theoretical frameworks, the study also employs econometric techniques to analyze the data collected. The analyst uses statistical methods to estimate the distribution of action sequences that can be rationalized, and to identify the set of sequences that cannot be rationalized. The analysis is conducted using a combination of ordinary least squares (OLS) and generalized method of moments (GMM) techniques.

The study also employs a duality formulation to simplify the identification of action sequences that cannot be rationalized. The duality formulation is used to characterize the set of distributions that can be rationalized, and to identify the set of sequences that cannot be rationalized. The duality formulation is based on the idea of deviation rules, and is used to provide a tight characterization of the set of action sequences that cannot be rationalized.

The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the research problem, by employing a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches. The study uses deviation rules to identify the set of distributions that can be rationalized, and to characterize the family of distributions

Results
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The results of our research reveal that the notion of true dominance can be expanded to allow for sequential information structures that depend on actions. This expansion, demonstrated by Makris and Renou [2023], provides a stronger and more nuanced framework for analyzing the empirical content of the model. Our research highlights the importance of considering the distributional structure of information available to the analyst, as it significantly affects the notion of dominance.

The main findings of our research are as follows:

The empirical content of the model can be characterized through a few deviation rules and one information structure, rather than through all possible deviation rules or information structures. This characterization is achieved by systematically identifying the binding deviation rules and information structures.

The notion of deviation rule is crucial in establishing true dominance, as it captures the idea of evaluating other sequences of actions that the agent might expect to choose. The adapted mapping D : A (A) plays a key role in this process, as it prescribes not only how the agent should deviate from the observed action sequence but also how it should deviate from other sequences of actions.

The results of our research demonstrate that the notion of true dominance is more nuanced than apparent dominance, as it requires evaluating other sequences of actions that the agent might expect to choose. This nuance is captured through the definition of deviation rule, which truly dominates w x and wy if and only if the average improvement brought about by the deviation rule is positive.

Our research also highlights the importance of considering the distributional structure of information available to the analyst. The analyst's ability to observe a whole distribution of action sequences significantly affects the notion of dominance, as it allows for the identification of binding deviation rules and information structures.

One of the key limitations of our research is the assumption of independence between the signals in the population. Without independence, all we can say is that the observed distribution must have its support on action sequences that are not truly dominated, highlighting the relevance of Theorem 1 even when population data is available.

The results of our research have significant implications for the analysis of dynamic decision-making under uncertainty. They provide a stronger and more nuanced framework for analyzing the empirical content of the model, and highlight the importance of considering the distributional structure of information available to the analyst.

In conclusion, our research demonstrates the importance of considering the distributional structure of information available to the analyst and the notion of deviation rule in establishing true dominance. The results of our research provide a stronger and more nuanced framework for analyzing the empirical content of the model, and highlight the relevance of Theorem 1 even when population data is available.

We believe that our research contributes to the existing literature on dynamic decision-making under uncertainty, and provides a new perspective on the analysis of empirical content. The results of our research have significant implications for the design of experiments and the analysis of dynamic decision-making under uncertainty.

The main limitations of our research are the assumption of independence between the signals in the population and the reliance on a few deviation rules and one information structure

Conclusion and Implications
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This paper presents a novel approach to characterizing the empirical content of Bayesian models of dynamic choice under uncertainty. Our results provide a comprehensive framework for identifying the sets of distributions that can be rationalized by Bayesian models, assuming that the analyst has access to a rich dataset that records both action sequences and realized states. The main findings of this paper can be summarized as follows:

Theorems 2 and 3 provide a complete characterization of the empirical content of Bayesian models of dynamic choice under uncertainty. Specifically, they show that an action sequence can be rationalized if and only if there exists a deviation rule that dominates it. Moreover, theorems 2 and 3 demonstrate that the analyst can identify the sets of distributions that can be rationalized by Bayesian models using a few deviation rules and one information structure. This approach allows us to systematically identify the binding deviation rules and information structures that rationalize particular action sequences.

Our results have important theoretical and practical implications. First, they provide a new tool for analyzing the empirical content of Bayesian models of dynamic choice under uncertainty. Second, they shed light on the role of information structures in shaping the behavior of Bayesian agents. Third, they have implications for the design of information systems that aim to facilitate decision-making under uncertainty. By providing a comprehensive framework for characterizing the empirical content of Bayesian models, our results can inform the development of new decision-making technologies that take into account the complexities of dynamic choice under uncertainty.

One limitation of this study is that it relies on several assumptions about the environment, including the independence of signals and the assumption that the analyst has access to a rich dataset that records both action sequences and realized states. Relaxing these assumptions could lead to more nuanced conclusions about the empirical content of Bayesian models. Future research directions include exploring the implications of our results for more complex decision-making scenarios, such as those involving multiple agents or uncertain information structures. Additionally, it would be interesting to investigate the empirical content of Bayesian models in other contexts, such as finance or economics.

In conclusion, this paper provides a novel approach to characterizing the empirical content of Bayesian models of dynamic choice under uncertainty. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering information structures in shaping the behavior of Bayesian agents and provide a new tool for analyzing the empirical content of Bayesian models. By systematically identifying the binding deviation rules and information structures that rationalize particular action sequences, our results can inform the development of new decision-making technologies that take into account the complexities of dynamic choice under uncertainty. Future research directions aim to explore the implications of our results for more complex decision-making scenarios and to investigate the empirical content of Bayesian models in other contexts. By doing so, we can deepen our understanding of the role of information structures in shaping decision-making under uncertainty and provide new insights for the design of information systems that facilitate decision-making in complex environments. 27The key thing to understand is that Myerson's codominance is done period-by-period.
