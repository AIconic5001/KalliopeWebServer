Recurrent Neural Networks The RNN architecture is specifically designed for se- quential data processing, such as text and genomics, and is capable of preserving state information across time steps [26] or a variable that marks the coordinates of a sequence such as base pair index. In this architecture, the output of a previous state serves as input to the current state, enabling the network to depend on past information while learning thecurrentcontext.Comprisingthreemainlayers,theRNN architecture

and exclusion criteria. From the perspective of surveying different epigenetic research problems, we have included the following keywords and terms in our search queries for selecting the papers: gene expression, epigenetic gene regulation, methylation, HMs, disease markers, transcrip- tion regulation, enhancer-promoter interaction, chromatin states, and chromatin reorganization. From the perspective of reviewing the investigation of the above problems using AI/ML/DL,wehavecombinedtheabovekeywordswiththe

Discovery of Chromatin states Due to DNA packaging and folding of chromosomes, different parts of the genome may interact with each other leading to differential accessibility for transcription factors to bind [164, 165, 166]. As a result, different regions of the genome differ in terms of their potential to get

Many factors at different levels influence gene expression such as variations in the non- coding part of DNA, methylation status, and HMs etc [13]. M.

Smoking, alcohol, diet, and stress can have a significant impact on epigenetic modifications because of their role as environmental toxins [9, 10, 11].
